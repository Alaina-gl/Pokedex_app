# üß† Pokedex iOS application

## üß∞ Tech Stack
- **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, **Kingfisher**, **Async/Await**, **Pok√©API**, **Xcode 16.2**

## üöÄ Functionalities:
- Load Pokemons from an API endpoint and display images on application.
- Contains image caching to prevent re-accessing images per load.
- Allows new image fetches when last row of images are loaded for the current fetch.
- Uses SwiftUI, async/await, Model View ViewModel (MVVM), @Observable and @State properties.

## Choice of framework explanation:
- Ensures all UI facing data logic in the view model are running on the MainActor to enable reactive UI states.
- Uses async/await to fetch API with rate limitation.
- To sure async/await function runs on view load, it's wrapped in a task which will get deallocated when view is gone.
- UI improvements include a change of color on current selected pokemon, flexible image frames for adaptive columnes, and built in navigation stack and ProgressView() with SwiftUI to provide additional user friendly interface.
- To ensure MVVM structure, model only contains necessary data definitions, view model contains business logic, view provides UI components and any logic to showcase different views. @ViewBuilder is used to allow dynamic view building.
